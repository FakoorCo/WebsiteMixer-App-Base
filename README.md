# A Python/Flask alternative to WordPress & Drupal

## Quick Start

* git clone https://github.com/bderstine/WebsiteMixer-App-Base
* ./setup.sh
* ./run.sh

## Installation

This project includes a setup.sh script that will setup the virtualenv environment for you. Just run and enjoy!

Want to customize your environment? Read setup.sh and update accordingly!

## Why?

I love WordPress and Drupal, but they can definitely be frustrating and have their own drawbacks. So I've been learning and working with Python more, stumbled upon Flask, and completely fell in love.

## To do

* Add multi-tenancy
* Add plugin manager
* Add template manager
