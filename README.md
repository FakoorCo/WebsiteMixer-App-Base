## Installation

NEW!! - This project now uses a web based installer/setup similar to WordPress! 

## Why?

I love WordPress and Drupal, but they can definitely be frustrating and have their own drawbacks. I used Django and it was a great toolset, but seemed like overkill for just building a basic website and made cloning websites and code bases a bit more difficult. So as I've been learning and working with Python more, I stumbled upon Flask, and completely fell in love.
