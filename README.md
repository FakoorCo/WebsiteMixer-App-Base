#WebsiteMixer-App-Base
### A Python/Flask alternative to WordPress & Drupal

See the [Changelog](http://websitemixer.com/changelog/) for more details.   

## Quick Start
I usually start with a fresh Ubuntu 14.04 server and use the follow commands:
$ git clone https://github.com/bderstine/WebsiteMixer-App-Base

$ cd WebsiteMixer-App-Base

$ pip install -r requirements.txt

$ ./run.py
 * Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
 * Restarting with stat

## Installation

This project includes a setup.sh script that will setup the virtualenv environment for you. Just run and enjoy!

Want to customize your environment? Read setup.sh and update accordingly!

## Why?

I love WordPress and Drupal, but they can definitely be frustrating and have their own drawbacks. So I've been learning and working with Python more, stumbled upon Flask, and completely fell in love.

## To do

See the [issues page](https://github.com/bderstine/WebsiteMixer-App-Base/issues) if you're interested in contributing or helping!

Thanks for stopping by and visiting!
